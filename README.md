Space invaders game
a space invaders game i made for the deauther watch, i got a little bored with deauther and wpa3 5ghz/6ghz is here. The deauther watch has an esp8266 a neopixel rgb led, a white led, a nice big i2c oled, several buttons, a rocker, battery and charging circuit, an on/off switch, .ufl antenna connector, and usb.

You can move your space ship left and right using the rocker, shooting is auto and nepixel lights when shooting and hit, shoot all the enemies before they reach bottom. Enjoy :)
